\section{Work in Progress}

\cventry{}{The Foundations of the Decoy Effect: Putting Theory to the Test}{}{joint with Ernst Fehr}{}{Modern theories which explain the decoy effect make similar predictions with very heterogenous underlying processes. We propose a precise experimental design to disentangle those theories. The project contributes experimentally to the decoy and perception and attention literature and answers the question if salience theory can be microfounded through a divisive normalization neural process. Further insights pin down the area in which the compromise effect occurs in hope for a more precise definition of it.}
\ \\ \ \\
\cventry{}{Nudging with Decoys}{}{}{}{In a follow-up study, I plan to employ the gained practical knowledge about the efficacy of decoys and introduce this device into the nudging literature.
Decoys have been used for some time by firms as a marketing device to motivate consumers to purchase more expensive products. To the best of my knowledge, there is no study that investigates the usefulness of decoys to guide individuals towards making better choices in order to increase social welfare. As decoys influence choices without limiting the set of available options, they have the potential to be useful additions or alternatives to the classic menu of nudging devices like default options and framing, which has been successfully employed to increase retirement saving, tax payments, charitable giving, and the installation of housing insulation.}
\ \\ \ \\
\cventry{}{Self-Deception and Deception}{}{}{}{I investigate Robert Trivers' social deception hypothesis. He claims that self-deception is a tool that evolved because it is instrumental in the efficient deception of others in social settings for material gain or status. I extend Schwardmann \& van der Weele's (ReStud R\&R) experimental setup to a three-party design. This allows to apply their findings to a broader set of client-agent settings like politicians running for office, salesmen or consultancy. Furthermore, it sheds new insights in the kind of self-deception that occurs in anticipation of social deception opportunities: Do subjects deceive themselves about their own capabilities to be more successful 'salesmen' or about the quality of their 'product' in order to convince a third party? Interaction between matched and mixed gender groups allows additional insights for the gender literature -- should agents be matched with the client's gender to perform optimally?}
\ \\ \ \\
\cventry{}{Political Corruption}{}{}{}{While political corruption is often associated with autocratic and developing countries (Serra, 2006), the recent affairs surrounding then Korean president Park Gun-hye and Fran√ßois Fillon, the republican candidate to the French presidency in the 2017 election, remind us that corruption is also a problem in western and democratic societies. Is it possible that democratic institutions psychologically motivate corruption in elected politicians on an individual level? Banerjee (2016) shows that subjects engage in corruptive practices if they feel entitled to additional private gains. We show that acting socially and serving the public can trigger such a feeling of entitlement and hence create individual corruption.}
