% \cventry{}{The Foundations of the Decoy Effect: Putting Theory to the Test}{}{joint with Ernst Fehr and Remi Daviet (Wharton)}{}{Modern theories which explain the decoy effect make similar predictions with very heterogenous underlying processes. We propose a precise experimental design to disentangle those theories. The project contributes experimentally to the decoy and perception and attention literature and answers the question if salience theory can be microfounded through a divisive normalization neural process. Further insights pin down the area in which the compromise effect occurs in hope for a more precise definition of it.}
% \ \\ \ \\\
% \cventry{}{Dynamic Context Effects}{}{}{}{Modern theories consider decoy and context effects in a static setting. The menu of perceived alternatives provides a context for the choice situation at hand. For real decision makers the context of a decision is not history free as they are typically influenced by previous decisions and roads not taken.
% In this project I develop a formal model of multi-attribute dynamic divisive normalization to tackle this phenomenon. In an experiment, I investigate the duration in which decoys can influence future decisions. This has strong influences for marketing practices and supplies extra incentives to firms to offer memorable and frequent rebate schemes.}
% \ \\ \ \\
% \cventry{}{Decoys Around the World}{}{joint with Christian Z\"und}{}{Are decoy effects a global phenomenon and do they interact with cultural norms? There is only limited research on decoy effects in the field and none in non-western countries. To fill this gap, we place Facebook advertisement for a fictitious product in various countries around the world. In our main treatment we place an advertisement featuring three items including a decoy. In a control, we place the same advertisement without a decoy being present.}
% \ \\ \ \\
% \cventry{}{Nudging with Decoys}{}{}{}{Decoys have been used by firms as a marketing device to motivate consumers to purchase more expensive products. This study is the first to investigates the usefulness of decoys as nuding devices employed to increase social welfare. As decoys influence choices without limiting the set of available options, they have the potential to be useful additions or alternatives to the classic menu of nudging devices like default options and framing, which has been successfully employed to increase retirement saving, tax payments, charitable giving, and the installation of housing insulation. This allows public agencies to improve the eficacy of welfare enhancing public policy.}
% \ \\ \ \\
% \cventry{}{Self-Deception and Deception}{}{}{}{I investigate Robert Trivers' social deception hypothesis. He claims that self-deception is a tool that evolved because it is instrumental in the efficient deception of others in social settings for material gain or status. I extend Schwardmann \& van der Weele's (ReStud R\&R) experimental setup to a three-party design. This allows to apply their findings to a broader set of client-agent settings like politicians running for office, salesmen or consultancy. Furthermore, it sheds new insights in the kind of self-deception that occurs in anticipation of social deception opportunities: Do subjects deceive themselves about their own capabilities to be more successful 'salesmen' or about the quality of their 'product' in order to convince a third party? Interaction between matched and mixed gender groups allows additional insights for the gender literature -- should agents be matched with the client's gender to perform optimally?}
% \ \\ \ \\
% \cventry{}{Political Corruption}{}{joint with Antonio Schiavone (U Warwick)}{}{While political corruption is often associated with autocratic and developing countries (Serra, 2006), the recent affairs surrounding then Korean president Park Gun-hye and Francois Fillon, the republican candidate to the French presidency in the 2017 election, remind us that corruption is also a problem in western and democratic societies. Is it possible that democratic institutions psychologically motivate elected politicians on an individual level to engage in corruption? Banerjee (2016) shows that feeling entitled to additional private gains is the main determinant to predict corruptive practices. We show that acting socially and serving the public can trigger such a feeling of entitlement and hence create corruption on the individual level in society as a whole.}
